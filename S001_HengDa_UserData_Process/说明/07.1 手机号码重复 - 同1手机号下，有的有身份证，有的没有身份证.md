## 07.1 手机号码重复 - 同1手机号下，有的有身份证，有的没有身份证

- 同1手机号下，有的有身份证，有的没有身份证

```sql
-- 确认总数仍为 416674-1=416673
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hengda;

-- 确认1734个手机号重复
SELECT phoneNumber,COUNT(phoneNumber) 
FROM hengda
GROUP BY phoneNumber
HAVING COUNT(phoneNumber) > 1

-- 确认1734个重复手机号，对应4387条记录
SELECT * FROM hengda WHERE phoneNumber IN 
    (SELECT t.phoneNumber FROM
        (SELECT phoneNumber,COUNT(phoneNumber) 
        FROM hengda
        GROUP BY phoneNumber
        HAVING COUNT(phoneNumber) > 1)t
    )
ORDER BY phoneNumber


-- 重复手机号中，同1条下，有的有身份证，有的没有
-- 处理思路：删除没有身份证的，保留有身份证的
